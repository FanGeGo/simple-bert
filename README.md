## BERT
This repository is a simple, easy-to-use PyTorch implementation of BERT. It is based on Dong-Hyun Lee's [pytorchic-bert](#somelink), which is in turn based off of HuggingFace's [implementation](#somelink). 

Key features: 
 * Load pre-trained weights from TensorFlow
 * Finetune BERT for text classification
 * Pretrain BERT from scratch on your own text data
